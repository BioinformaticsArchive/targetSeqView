The purpose of  makeAltBam.py is to take a bwa aligned bam file with uniquely mapped reads and create a new bam file with multiply mapped reads.
The positions specified in the XA tag of the input file are given their own line in the out bam file. An alternate method to obtain a mutliply
mapped bam file would be involve using bowtie2 with the -a or -k option set. To run the pythong script (from a linux prompt):

python makeAltBam.py $bamin $bamout
